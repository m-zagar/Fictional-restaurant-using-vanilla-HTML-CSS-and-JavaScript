# Fictional restaurant using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript
A project for the "Development of Web Applications" class. (Undergraduate University Study of Computing)

The goal of the project was to create a web application that would, as closely as possible, mimic a website of a fully functional restaurant. 

The idea was to have various features that real life restaurant websites have, such as restaurant info, a viewable menu, means to contact the restaurant and ordering and order tracking. 

The code was written in vanilla HTML, PHP and JavaScript.
